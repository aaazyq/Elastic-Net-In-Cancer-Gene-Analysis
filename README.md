Empirical Evaluation Of Elastic Net In Cancer Gene Analysis

----

We did a data analytic and applied statistics project in the context of high dimensional cancer gene data modeling. Variable selection is of paramount importance in
gene data analysis because the data often has extremely high dimensions relatively to the
sample size. Among all kinds of variable selection techniques, elastic net is excellent for its
parameter estimation ability, the balance of fitting and penalizing, and a unique advantage
of grouping effect.

In our project, we trained several gene TP53 inactivation classifiers, compared the
performance of lasso, ridge and elastic net in sparse logistic regression and support vector
machine. We verified that logistic regression is a better model in this project and elastic
net performs better than lasso and ridge regularization, with a higher test AUC (93.6%)
and reasonable proportion of selected variable. In addition, we did further analysis to make
sure this elastic net model has biological significance and good interpretability.
